So far we've been focusing a lot on running containers and haven't much dug into building them. This is on purpose because most of the benefit of containers for developers comes from the running the containers. If you only learn one thing, it should be how to run containers.

That said, let's learn to build our own containers. We'll again be using Docker for this though there are other ways to do this. Docker has a special file called a `Dockerfile` which allows you to outline how a container will be built. Each line in a Docker file is a new a directive of how to change your Docker container.

A _big key_ with Docker container is that they're supposed to be disposable. You should be able to create them and throw them away as many times as necessary. In other words: adopt a mindset of making everything short-lived. There are other, better tools for long-running, custom containers.

Let's make the most basic Dockerfile ever. Let's make a new folder, maybe on your desktop. Put a file in there called `Dockerfile` (no extension.) In your file, put this.

## The most basic Dockerfile-based Container

```dockerfile
FROM node:12-stretch

CMD ["node", "-e", "console.log(\"hi lol\")"]
```

The first thing on each line (`FROM` and `CMD` in this case) are called _instructions_. They don't technically have to be all caps but it's a convention so that the file is easier to read. Each one of these instructions incrementally changes the container from the state it was in previously, adding what we call a _layer_.

Let's go ahead and build our container. Run (from inside of the directory of where your Dockerfile is)

```bash
docker build .
```

You should see it output a bunch of stuff and it'll leave you with the hash of an image. After each instruction, you'll see a hash similar to the ones we've been using for the IDs for the containers. You know why that is? It's because each one of those layers is in-and-of itself a valid container image! This ends up being important later and we'll discuss it in a bit.

Our container seems to have only two instructions in its Dockerfile, but actually it has many, many more. How? The first instruction, `FROM node:12-stretch` actually means _start_ with the `node` container. That container itself [comes from another Dockerfile][docker-node] which builds its own container, which itself [comes from another Dockerfile][buildpack], which comes ultimately from the [Debian][debian] image.

This is something very powerful about Docker: you can use images to build other images and build on the work of others. Instead of having to worry about how to install Debian and all the necessary items to build Node.js from its source, we can just start with a well-put-together image from the community.

Okay, so we start with `node:12-stretch` and then we add the `CMD` instruction. There will only ever be one of these in effect in a Dockerfile. If you have multiple it'll just take the last one. This is what you want Docker to do when someone runs the container. In our case, we're running `node -e "console.log('hi lol')"` from within the container. If you didn't know, `node -e` will run whatever is inside of the following quotes with Node.js. In this case, we're logging out `hi lol` to the console.

You _can_ put `CMD node -e "console.log('hi lol')"` as that last line, and it'll work, but it's not the preferred way of doing it. This won't actually go through `bash`, which is simpler and usually safer. I do it this way because the docs strongly encourage you to do it this way.

So, in essence, our container nabs a `node:12-stretch` container. When we have it, it executes a `node` command when you run it. Let's try it. Grab the hash from your build and run

```bash
docker run <ID>
```

It's a little inconvenient to have to refer to it by ID, it'd be easier if it had a name. So let's do that! Try:

```bash
docker build . --tag my-node-app ## or -t instead of --tag
docker run my-node-app
```

Much easier to remember the name rather than a hash. If you want to version it yourself, you can totally do this:

```bash
docker build -t my-node-app:1 .
docker run my-node-app:1
```

Now change your `Dockerfile` so that it logs out `wat` instead of `hi lol`. After you do that.

```bash
docker build -t my-node-app:2 .
docker run my-node-app:2
docker run my-node-app:1
```

You can version your containers and hold on to older ones, just in case!
