## namespace

While chroot is a pretty straightforward, namespaces and cgroups are a bit more nebulous to understand but no less important. Both of these next two features are for security and resource management.

Let's say you're running a big server that's in your home and you're selling space to other people (that you don't know) to run their code on your server. What sort of concerns would you have? Let's say you have Alice and Bob who are running e-commerce services dealing with lots of money. They themselves are good citizens of the servers and minding their own business. But then you have Eve join the server who has other intentions: she wants to steal money, source code, and whatever else she can get her hands on from your other tenants on the server. If you just gave all three of them root access to server, what's to stop Eve from taking everything? Or what if she just wants to disrupt their businesses, even if she's not stealing anything?

Your first line of defense is that you could log them into `chroot`'d environments and limit them to only those. Great! Now they can't see each others' files. Problem solved? Well, no, not quite yet. Despite the fact that she can't see the files, she can still see all the processes going on inside the server. She can kill processes, unmount filesystem and potentially even hijack processes.

Enter namespaces. Namespaces allow you to hide processes from other processes. If we give each `chroot`'d environment different sets of namespaces, now Alice, Bob, and Eve can't see each others' processes (they even get different process PIDs, or process IDs, so they can't guess what the others have) and you can't steal or hijack what you can't see!

There's a lot more depth to namespaces beyond what I've outlined here. The above is describing _just_ the UTS (or UNIX Timesharing) namespace. There are more namespaces as well and this will help these containers stay isloated from each other.

## The problem with `chroot` alone

Now, this isn't secure. The only thing we've protected is the file system, mostly.

1. `chroot` in a terminal into our environment
1. In another terminal, run `docker exec -it docker-host bash`. This will get another terminal session #2 for us (I'll refer to the `chroot`'d environment as #1)
1. Run `tail -f /my-new-root/secret.txt &` in #2. This will start an infinitely running process in the background.
1. Run `ps` to see the process list in #2 and see the `tail` process running. Copy the PID (process ID) for the tail process.
1. In #1, the `chroot`'d shell, run `kill <PID you just copied>`. This will kill the tail process from inside the `chroot'd` environment. This is a problem because that means chroot isn't enough to isolate someone. We need more barriers. This is just one problem, processes, but it's illustrative that we need more isolation beyond just the file system.

## Safety with namespaces

So let's create a chroot'd environment now that's isolated using namespaces using a new command: `unshare`. `unshare` creates a new isolated namespace from its parent (so you, the server provider can't spy on Bob nor Alice either) and all other future tenants. Run this:

**NOTE**: This next command downloads about 150MB and takes at least a few minutes to run.

```bash
exit # from our chroot'd environment if you're still running it, if not skip this

# install debootstrap
apt-get update -y
apt-get install debootstrap -y
debootstrap --variant=minbase bionic /better-root

# head into the new namespace'd, chroot'd environment
unshare --mount --uts --ipc --net --pid --fork --user --map-root-user chroot /better-root bash # this also chroot's for us
mount -t proc none /proc # process namespace
mount -t sysfs none /sys # filesystem
mount -t tmpfs none /tmp # filesystem
```

This will create a new environment that's isolated on the system with its own PIDs, mounts (like storage and volumes), and network stack. Now we can't see any of the processes!

Now try our previous exercise again.

1. Run `tail -f /my-new-root/secret.txt &` from #2 (not the unshare env)
1. Run `ps` from #1, grab pid for `tail`
1. Run `kill <pid for tail>`, see that it doesn't work

We used namespaces to protect our processes! We could explore the other namespaces but know it's a similar exercise: using namespaces to restrict capabilities of containers to interfering with other containers (both for nefarious purposes and to protect ourselves from ourselves.)
