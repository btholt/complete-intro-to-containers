We've now built a nice little container for our Node.js app and we absolutely could ship it as-is to production. However there are a few things we can do to make things even faster, cheaper, and more secure.

## Making your containers smaller

Making your containers smaller is a good thing for a few reasons. For one, everything tends to get a bit cheaper. Moving containers across the Internet takes time and bits to do. If you can make those containers smaller, things will go faster and you'll require less space on your servers. Often private container registries (like personal Docker Hubs, Azure Container Registry is a good example) charge you by how much storage you're using.

Beyond that, having _fewer things_ in your container means you're less susceptible to bugs. Let's say there's a Python exploit that's going around that allows hackers to get root access to your container. If you don't have Python in your container, you're not vulnerable! And obviously if you do have Python installed (even if you're not using it) you're vulnerable. So let's see how to make your container a bit smaller.

In your previous Dockerfile, change the first line (`FROM`)

```dockerfile
FROM node:12-alpine

USER node

RUN mkdir /home/node/code

WORKDIR /home/node/code

COPY --chown=node:node package-lock.json package.json ./

RUN npm ci

COPY --chown=node:node . .

CMD ["node", "index.js"]
```

Our image size (by comparing the `"Size"` field in in `docker inspect my-app`) went from 913MB to 86MB, just like that. We shed quite a bit of cruft that we didn't need in Ubuntu and we didn't even need to change anything in our Dockerfile. Honestly, that's unusual. When you strip _everything_ out typically you'll have to go back and add some of them back in. But in this case we're golden!

Alpine, if you remember, is a bare bones alternative to Ubuntu. It's built on Busybox Linux which is a 2MB distro of Linux (Alpine is 5MB.) `node:12-alpine` itself is about `80MB` and `node:latest is about 908MB`.

When should you select Alpine? My general feeling (this is a Brian Holt opinion, not a community opinion, so take it with a grain of salt) is that the "end destination" container is where Alpine is the best. It cuts all cruft out which is super helpful for end-deployment scenarios due to security and size. But minimal containers can be annoying for development scenarios because they lack just about everything necessary to build your software, making you have to hand-install everything you need. In these "middle scenarios" where the container is not really the destination, but is just another tool in your development system (where that's a multi-stage build or a development container), I'll reach for Ubuntu or Debian.
