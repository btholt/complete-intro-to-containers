For one, everything tends to get a bit cheaper. Moving containers across the Internet takes time and bits to do. If you can make those containers smaller, things will go faster and you'll require less space on your servers. Often private container registries (like personal Docker Hubs, Azure Container Registry is a good example) charge you by how much storage you're using.</p>\n<p>Beyond that, having less <em>things</em> in your container means you're less susceptible to bugs. Let's say there's a Python exploit that's going around that allows hackers to get root access to your container. If you don't have Python in your container, you're not vulnerable! And obviously if you do have Python installed (even if you're not using it) you're vulnerable. So let's see how to make your container a bit smaller.</p>\n<p>In your previous Dockerfile, change the first line (<code class=\"language-text\">FROM</code>)</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"dockerfile\"><pre class=\"language-dockerfile\"><code class=\"language-dockerfile\"><span class=\"token keyword\">FROM</span> node<span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span>alpine\n\n<span class=\"token keyword\">USER</span> node\n\n<span class=\"token keyword\">RUN</span> mkdir /home/node/code\n\n<span class=\"token keyword\">WORKDIR</span> /home/node/code\n\n<span class=\"token keyword\">COPY</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">-</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">-</span>chown=node<span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span>node package<span class=\"token punctuation\">-</span>lock.json package.json ./\n\n<span class=\"token keyword\">RUN</span> npm ci\n\n<span class=\"token keyword\">COPY</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">-</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">-</span>chown=node<span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span>node . .\n\n<span class=\"token keyword\">CMD</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span><span class=\"token string\">\"node\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"index.js\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>Our image size (by comparing the <code class=\"language-text\">&quot;Size&quot;</code> field in in <code class=\"language-text\">docker inspect my-app</code>) from 913MB to 86MB just like that. We shed quite a bit of cruft that we didn't need in Ubuntu and we didn't even need to change anything in our Dockerfile. Honestly, that's unusual. When you strip <em>everything</em> out typically you'll have to go back and add some of them back in. But in this case we're golden!</p>\n<p>Alpine, if you remember, is a bare bones alternative to Ubuntu. It's built on Busybox Linux which is a 2MB distro of Linux (Alpine is 5MB.) <code class=\"language-text\">node:alpine</code> itself is about <code class=\"language-text\">80MB</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">node:latest is about 908MB</code>.</p>\n<p>When should you select Alpine? My general feeling (this is a Brian Holt opinion, not a community one so take it with a grain of salt) is that the \"end destination\" container is where Alpine is the best. It cuts all cruft out which is super helpful for end-deployment sorts of scenarios due to security and size but it also can be annoying for development scenarios because it lacks just about everything necessary for those, making you have to hand install everything you need. In these \"middle scenarios\" where it's not really the destination and the container is just another tool in your development system (where that's a multi stage build or a development container) I'll reach for Ubuntu or Debian.</p>","frontmatter":{"path":"/alpine-linux","title":"Alpine Linux","order":5,"section":"Making Tiny Containers","description":"Tiny containers make a lot of things easier and more secure.
